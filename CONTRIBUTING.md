## <a name="h.vt7xl9xpkgu9"></a>Structure of articles

In order to keep articles concise, we attempt to follow a specific structure that should allow readers to understand the topic even if it means starting from scratch.

The currently suggested structure of articles is as follow:

- Prerequisites: List any prerequisite to understanding the content of the article at hand. If possible, link to existing articles.
- Overview: Much like Wikipedia’s format, an overview of the topic allows a user to get a quick glance at the content that will be exposed in the rest of the article.
- Main content
- Related articles: Similar to prerequisites, related articles are topics that one may be interested in exploring to further their understanding of the topic discussed in the article.
