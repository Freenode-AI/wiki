### Semantic Memory: Mapping Consistency to Language

The form of memory must be capable of composing identities in a network of relations, of relating identities in order to map consistencies in one context to terms in another, and of arbitrarily associating and differentiating identities.

### Episodic Memory: Encapsulating Space-Time

The form of memory must be capable of composing identities of encapsulation that distinguish one informal context from another in order to determine which formal treatments might be considered contextually appropriate.

### Procedural Memory: Organizing Sequential Logic

The form of memory must be capable of composing branching sequences of logical expression that determine which branch to associate based on procedural determinations as the logic is carried out.

- Perceptual Cognition, the evaluation of sensory perception in terms of language.
- Attentional Awareness, a language-capable noise filter.

Resulting in fundamental features that permit the development of interactive agents capable of independent intelligent thought:

- Self-identity, the definition of an independent formulation of an intelligent task.
- Self-reference, the definition of relation between an intelligent task and conditions it might encounter.
- Orientation, the negotiation of difference between “self-identity” and “self-reference”.
- Desire, the negotiation of encounters in order to reorganize “orientation”.
- Opinion, a language-capable noise filter.
- Creativity, experimentation with apparently-permissible ranges of variation.

# AGI Through “Critical Theory”

Critical theory is a specific domain of philosophical, literary, and psychoanalytic work.

Critical theory developed as a field in response to the relationship the Nazi, Fascist, and Communist projects maintained with philosophy:

- The Nazi project was premised on a rigorously self-enclosed philosophical definition of the supposed moral good.
- The Fascist project was politically and economically left-leaning, yet expressed, participated in, and collaborated on many of the same forms of violence perpetrated by the Nazi regime.
- When Adolf Eichmann was captured and put on trial, he deployed moral philosopher Immanuel Kant’s famous “categorical imperative” in his own defense— in a fashion that is arguably justifiable from Kant’s own perspective.
- The numerous communist projects each pursued explicit philosophical terms of articulation, each in the name of a supposed left, each perpetrating its own form of extreme violence.

It was understood that philosophy had to be transformed into something other than the contemplation of the good.

In particular, philosophy now had to confront the problem that morality can create a state of exception wherein it assumes power by suspending itself. The question of responsibility by way of the Nazi and Fascist projects raised a new spectre: what animates the masses?

Critical theory developed as an extra-disciplinary approach to considering this problem: the problem of agency, understood as the conditions of social enervation. The agent was now to be understood as the locus of exchange between its singular investment and its opening to untold potential.

Critical theory thus transforms philosophical considerations into abstract mathematics, and develops a rigorous vocabulary appropriate to the stakes. This vocabulary is unknown and strange to most, but for the same reason offers a great deal of potential for developing AGI in new directions.

What should not be expected here is computation, treatments of algorithms, or the formulation of this vocabulary in terms of a glossary. The vocabulary being formulated is addressing points of complexity that must be laid out and presented before they can be given a metric. The terms of rigour found here concern language, and much of the engagement will be about how the stakes could ever even be discussed, much less consolidated and established as given.

The overall frame of reference can be understood by way of Turing’s term “abstract machine” (a term used by several of these thinkers). The goal is to compose abstract machines of thought that open perspectives of consideration, expose problems of composition, and render new possibilities of determination.
